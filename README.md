## Terminal Radio

A Selenium-based Python script run in the console that creates playlists of music videos as urls. I had a bit of choice fatigue when it came to deciding what music to listen to, so I created this to function as a radio of sorts. You call the script, and play a random song in the playlist.

Supported options:
* next - loads a random song in the playlist
* erase - removes the current song from the playlist
* search - creates a playlist and overwrites the previous one
* save - saves a url in the playlist itself
* load - loads the url that you saved
* quit - saves the state of the playlist

I think it's saved me a lot of browsing time looking for music to study to, so give it a try!
